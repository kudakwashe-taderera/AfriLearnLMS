The system you're building is perfect so far, but we need to fix a major misunderstanding in user flow and page structure. We're building AfriLearnHub, a modern, professional national learning and career platform for Zimbabwe using React (frontend), Django (backend), PostgreSQL (database), Tailwind CSS (styling).

🔁 General Fix:
Career Guidance and Study Dashboard (Canvas style) must be on separate pages.

A new student who registers must land on the Career Guidance Page first, not the study dashboard.

The study dashboard only becomes active after the student selects subjects and registers for courses.

👤 O Level Flow (Fix and Confirm):
✅ After account creation:

Redirect to Career Guidance Page with:

List of O Level subjects.

Selection of preferred subjects.

Display A Level combinations, university programs, and career suggestions.

Show next-step button like "Register Subjects".

✅ After subject registration:

Redirect to O Level Study Dashboard (Canvas-style):

Show registered subjects.

Notes, assignments, quizzes from teachers.

Learning resources (videos, books, tutorials).

Progress tracking.

Add a separate page for:

Exploring all Zimbabwean universities and colleges.

Viewing courses per university.

Registering interest in courses.

👤 A Level Flow (Fix and Confirm):
✅ Career Guidance Page:

Students select/input their A Level subjects.

Show university programs, career options, and application eligibility.

✅ Subject registration activates:

A Level Study Dashboard (Canvas-style).

Notes, quizzes, assignments, and learning materials.

Track progress in registered subjects.

✅ Add pages to explore:

List of all Zimbabwe universities.

View programs, application status, and prerequisites.

👤 University Flow (Fix and Confirm):
✅ After login:

Let students register for a program/course first.

Once a course is selected:

Redirect to their University Study Dashboard.

✅ Features:

Cross-registration support (take classes from other universities).

Uploads: Lectures, assignments, resources per subject.

Progress and GPA tracking.

✅ Add:

Page to explore all universities and their courses.

👤 Jobs Portal (Activate Fully):
✅ Add a Jobs section to every student dashboard.

✅ Students can:

Search for jobs/internships.

Apply directly.

View application status and ranking.

✅ Employers can:

Post jobs.

View ranked applicants with their full academic background (O Level → University).

🏛️ Admin / Government Fixes:
✅ Add separate Admin Dashboard.

✅ Admin can:

View all registered users, their level, and performance.

Manage subjects, programs, universities, job posts, and employers.

View analytics (total users, courses, applications, jobs).

🧠 General Design Notes:
Every route and page must now be working.

All roles must see only relevant content.

Use Tailwind CSS for top-tier UI.

All content must carry the AfriLearnHub brand across all pages.

Add buttons and links to navigate between:

Career Guidance → Subject Registration → Dashboard.

Explore Universities & Jobs independently.
