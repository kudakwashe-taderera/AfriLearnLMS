Hi Replit, we’re now building a full-scale national-level education and career system called EduVerse. What you’ve done so far is great — please don’t change that foundation — but we’re now revamping it completely into a modern, professional, and advanced system that supports individuals from O Level through university and into employment.

Think of it as an intelligent combination of Canvas + Handshake + AI-powered Career Guidance, but centralized for an entire nation.

System Overview

Goal: Create a unified platform where a student starts from O Level and uses the same account through A Level, university, and into their career — with real-time guidance, access to educational resources, inter-university flexibility, and job opportunities.
