We are building a full national education and career system called AfriLearnHub. The system is already created, login and registration are working, but we need to expand it to match the full vision. Use React for frontend, Django for backend, PostgreSQL for database, Tailwind CSS for styling. The system must be fully responsive, clean, professional, and modern. Follow the instructions below exactly and keep everything organized by user type.

üë§ For O Level Students:
After registering and logging in, show a Career Guidance Dashboard that includes:

A list of all O Level subjects in Zimbabwe (checkable buttons).

After selecting subjects, show:

Possible A Level subject combinations they qualify for.

Possible university/college programs.

Possible careers.

Allow them to select their preferred subjects and register.

After registration, they should land on their O Level Dashboard:

Display registered subjects.

A section for learning resources per subject (textbooks, videos, tutorials).

Assignments, notes, quizzes uploaded by their teachers (Canvas-style).

Add a University Explorer tab:

List all Zimbabwean universities and colleges.

When a student clicks on one:

Show all available programs/courses.
